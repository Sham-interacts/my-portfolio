        I am a Front-End Developer with over 4 years of experience building
        responsive, high-performance web applications using React, JavaScript
        (ES6+), HTML5, and CSS3. My work has focused on creating reusable UI
        components, integrating REST APIs, and optimising frontend performance
        in enterprise-scale applications.
        <br />
        <br />I have experience working in Agile teams, collaborating closely
        with backend, QA, and UX partners to deliver reliable and user-friendly
        interfaces. I value clean code, accessibility, and maintainable frontend
        architecture, and I am actively seeking opportunities where I can
        contribute to meaningful products and continue growing as a frontend
        engineer.
